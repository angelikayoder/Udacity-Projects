# My Neighborhood Project

This is Angelika Yoder's "My Neighborhood" project for Udacity's Front End Nanodegree Program.
It's a map app, built with React,  that shows you Czech resturants on Chicago's West Side. You can filter the list of restaurants, which is provided through the Foursquare API, by typing in the search box on the left side.

To get started viewing the project:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

After completing the previous steps, the project can be viewed on http://localhost:3000/

Some future steps for this project may involve changing the search box to accommodate the input of the user's chosen city which would then search the Foursquare API for any/all Czech restaurants in the user's own city. Another possible change may be to change the map markers to little Czech flags to go along with the Czech theme of the project.
