# Classic Arcade Game Clone -FEND Udacity Nanodegree Program

## Object of the Game

Get your guy across the road before one of the bugs runs into him and takes away one of your stars! Each time you make it across, you win 100 points and gets sent back to the start to run across again and earn more points. You get three "lives" to get as many points as you can.

## Instructions

-Use the arrow keys to move your sprite across the road to the water at the top.
-Avoid getting hit by a bug!
-If you make to the water without getting hit, you earn 100 points and get to try again.
-If you get hit, you lose one of your three lives (stars) at the top of the game.
-Once you lose all your lives, you'll see the total score earned through the game.
-If you'd like to play the game again, hit the refresh button when the game finishes.
-Adjust your computer/device volume before starting because this game has sounds.
